# Node-Express-Template
A Generic Node.JS and Express Template For Backend Development.

## About
This is a template for a generic server with minimum functionality that can be easily built upon and configured to meet a variety of needs. The code itself is comprised of the basic functinality and setup one would need as well as detailed comments to help any developer customize the code base to their needs.

For the sake of simplicity in this particular template, we will only use a "local database" such as naturally occuring datastructures available within Javascript like lists.
